Description: C++ library for multidimensional time series -- header files
 Uchronia is a C++ library designed to handle multidimensional time series 
 and ensemble thereof. Some key capabilities are:
 .
 * Off the shelf support for point time series and time series 
 of ensemble forecasts
 .
 * Extensibility to various data types (numeric or not) through 
 C++ templates, e.g. to a "time series of spatial grids"
 .
 * High level language bindings for R, Python, Matlab, and 
 others via a consistent "C" API. 
 .
 This package contains the uchronia header files.
